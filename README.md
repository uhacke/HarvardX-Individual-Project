Predict NHL Players salaries 2020/21
Hello,
I am a novice coder and post this as part of the HarvardX Data Science course. Go Oilers.

Data for the 2020/21 season from HockeyReference (https://www.hockey-reference.com/friv/current_nhl_salaries.cgi) and NHL (http://www.nhl.com/stats/skaters).

I am responsible for any errors in the data.
